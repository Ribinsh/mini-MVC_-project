# simple-e-commerce-Web-Application-using-MVC

Simple Login, signup, homepage and a admin page.

Admin page has options to add, remove and edit products

And can also edit user name and adress.(Not a good practice, instead add option to block/unblock users)

Used hbs as view engine.

Using MVC instead of Express-generator.

My code is not perfect, any suggestions are highly appreciated.

Don't forget to run `npm install`.
